# Boids2D

Boids2D is a demonstrational 2D bird-like-objects Unity simulation.

Simulation imitiates flocking behaviour of birs and group-focused behaviour of shoals of fish.

Such complex behaviour can be seperated to three simpler factors: separation, cohesion and alignment.

Beyond doing that, this project also presents an interactive User Interface to control each factors influence on the boids movement.

Here are some examples of the simulation.
